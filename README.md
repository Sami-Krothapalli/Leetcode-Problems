# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode Solutions repository! This repository serves as a personal log where I document my journey through LeetCode problems, including both my initial working and finalized solutions. My aim is to build a comprehensive collection of coding challenges and solutions that not only track my progress but also assist others in their learning journey.



Each problem has its own directory, named after the LeetCode problem title or number, containing at least two files:
- A solution file in the appropriate language (e.g., `solution.py`, `solution.java`)
- A `README.md` file with the problem description, my thought process, and an explanation of the solution.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the solutions and use them as a reference. I encourage you to attempt the problems on your own before looking at the solutions here. Remember, the goal is to learn and improve problem-solving skills, not just to find the answers.

## Contribution

This is a personal documentation project, and as such, I am not looking for contributions. However, if you have any suggestions or feedback on how to improve the explanations or the repository's structure, feel free to open an issue.
